### Small Nodejs application
> Create a small node js terminal application to keep track of a users personal information.

1. create an object that can hold the users name, address, phone number, and other personal information.

2. take user input from the console to update the object.

3. keep the functions and objects modularized by keeping them in their own module (files).

The program should be ran with `npm start` command and should continue to run until the user decides to stop.
