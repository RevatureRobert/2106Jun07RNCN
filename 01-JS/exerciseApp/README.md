### Small Nodejs Application

> Create a small nodejs terminal application to keep track of a user's personal information.

1. Create an object that can hold the users' name, address, phone number, and other personal information.
2. Take user input from the console to update the object.
3. Keep the functions and objects modularized by keeping them in their own module (files).

The program should be run with `npm start` command and should continue to run until the user decides to stop.
