### Introduction
Your initial project for this program is to complete a Restful API. The application should show experience in 
the technologies and will be your chance to showcase your skills to the training and QC team. Security and 
performance should be considered in your approach to solutions. Overall, the theme and implementation is 
entirely up to you. Keep the presentation professional with a 3-5 minute time window. The presentation should
use Postman to show a functioning api, deliver well formatted information, follow REST best practices, provide accurate
documentation, and have functional/meaningful unit tests.
