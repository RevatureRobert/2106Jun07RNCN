# Project 2

## Social Media Rewrite

### Introduction 
Rewrite your Project 1 using the following technologies:

#### Technologies
1. React Native
2. AWS Serverless Architecture
3. AWS CodePipeline
4. AWS Amplify/SAM/CFN/Serverless-FW as backend build tool
5. Expo as React Native build tool

### Requirements

---
**Backend**
1. Application must be serverless, implementing AWS Services.
2. All code must be written in Typescript
3. Work must be done with an Agile/Scrum workflow. Implement burn down charts, assign a Scrum Master, hold daily stand ups, and work in 1 week sprints.
4. 100% Code coverage on Lambda functions.
5. CI/CD Pipeline implementation using AWS CodePipeline.
6. Lambda functions deployed as containers.

---
**Front end**
1. Application must be able to be fully built and deployable for both Android and IOS. Presentation should be done with everyone, including audience, installing the app on their devices to follow along.
2. Presentation may be done with an emulator to provide a standard viewing of the application.
3. Code coverage should be at 30% for React Native application, testing should be provided for both Android and IOS devices.
4. CI/CD Pipeline for automated testing and packaging [deployed package can either be to s3 bucket for download/install or to app store (This can be done for Android with owners granting permissions on their device, IOS may differ here)]
> Note: as an attendant, you do not have to enable this feature or follow along on your device. I am not requiring anybody to make changes to lessen security on their device and if you are not comfortable with making those changes for yours or others apps then do not do so. These apps can be run on emulators where the apk can be downloaded and ran on that device instead of your personal one.
